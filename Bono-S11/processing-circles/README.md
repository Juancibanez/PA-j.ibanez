# Processing Circles Project

This project is a simple web application that generates circles at random positions on the screen using Processing.js.

## Project Structure

- `src/sketch.js`: Contains the main logic for the Processing sketch, initializing the canvas and drawing circles.
- `index.html`: The main HTML document that sets up the structure of the web page and includes references to the JavaScript and CSS files.
- `styles.css`: Contains styles for the web page, including background color and font styles.
- `README.md`: Documentation for the project.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
3. You should see a canvas with randomly generated circles displayed on the screen.

## Functionality

The application uses JavaScript to create a dynamic visual experience by generating circles in random positions each time the page is loaded. The circles are drawn on a canvas element, providing an engaging and interactive display.
